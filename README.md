The UCI Heart Disease dataset is utilized to develop a K-Nearest Neighbors classifier to predict the likelihood of a patient having heart disease. The test set had an accuracy of 86.96%. However, the limitation of the data may have influenced the accuracy of the model performance.

The final model was trained using the following features:
- Oldpeak
- Sex_M
- ExerciseAngina_Y
- ST_Slope_Flat
- ST_Slope_Up

Next Steps:
To get a model with better accuracy we can:
- 1.Try different features.
- 2.Expand the grid search parameters to identify more optimal hyperparameters.
- 3.Explore other algorithms that might perform better than k-NN.
- 4.Collect more data
